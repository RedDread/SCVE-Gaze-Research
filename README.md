# Salford_CVE_Poker

## Todo  
1. Revert to major restructre commit and create a new branch.
2. Update readme with build and deployment 

## Notes

1. Should the large bet be displayed?

Check/call - calls the current raise/bet.
Bet - raises the bet to the players desired raise or the minimum raise, whichever is greater.

2. If more than one player is in play at the end

3. If players all in before the hand has finished, a single player will have to check through to see the full deal.
* Could disable other buttons if this becomes an issue (ie player goes all in again)

4. Can not stop/pause/restart blinds clock
* Could put controls on the blinds clock
